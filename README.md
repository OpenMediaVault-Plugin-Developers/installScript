- Please use a new SD card if installing on an arm/sbc device and flash it with the latest Debian OS Lite (without desktop environment) or Server image available for your SBC.
- This script will install openmediavault, omv-extras, and flashmemory. If you already have openmediavault installed don't worry, your openmediavault will be preserved, only the not installed will be added to the system.
- Installing OMV with a desktop environment is NOT supported.  Please read the forum for the many reasons why.
